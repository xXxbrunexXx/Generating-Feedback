# Generating-Feedback
In this repository, you will find databases that have been used in the work titled "Harnessing Graph Neural Networks to Craft Fragrances Based on Consumer Feedback". The first databases included are the following:

Parfumo:
This database contains all the information extracted from the Parfumo forum. It includes 27,443 perfumes, with basic information (name, brand, year and target gender), fragrance notes, and numerical evaluations for scent and other aspects of the perfumes.

Autoencoder_embeddings:
This database contains the compressed form of the boolean matrix that relates perfumes to their fragrance notes. It results from the execution of the Autoencoder on the boolean matrix.

Train GGNN:
_describe_

Transfer Learning:
one database for each fragrance note.
